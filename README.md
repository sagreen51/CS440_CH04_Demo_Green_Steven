For CS440 test 

I chose the GNU Public License because it requires anyone who sends and edit or original peice 
of my code to make the source avaliable under the same terms. That is they must make it with a GNU 
Public License as well. No one is allowed to is allowed to make a modified version of my program and
restrictions to it. It must have free distribution just as mine is. I believe a large majority of software
should be free to the general public. Money can be made in other ways of the software varying from support 
to better and more detailed services.
